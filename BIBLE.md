# THE RESORT - BIBLE

## Story Premise

Door County, Wisconsin, summer 1977. Milwaukee Detective Mike Callahan, reassigned after a shooting incident, partners with FBI analyst Jessica Reeves on her first field case when college-age seasonal workers vanish from dying lakefront resorts. Three bodies surface in Lake Michigan - weighted, posed, and photographed before death. The killer's Kemper-style photography obsession captures victims alive and unaware, then documents their posed corpses in abandoned resort locations. As the investigation penetrates the seasonal workers' subculture of parties in empty hotels and beach hookups, Callahan's childhood resort memories clash with Reeves's behavioral analysis. The town desperately conceals the investigation to preserve tourism. Evidence points to someone grieving the resort era's death, documenting its decay through victims who represent careless youth partying in sacred ruins.

## Lead Investigator: Detective Mike Callahan

**Age:** 35
**Agency:** Milwaukee Police Department, Homicide Division (temporarily assigned Door County)
**Background:** Fifteen-year MPD veteran with solid arrest record. Grew up working-class Milwaukee, father was machinist. Three months ago, Callahan shot an armed suspect during convenience store robbery - justified shooting, but the kid was sixteen. Department-mandated counseling, then "temporary assignment assisting Door County Sheriff's Department" - effectively exile while brass decides his future. Divorced two years, no kids. Drinks more than he should but functional.

**Investigative Approach:** Traditional detective work - witness interviews, timeline reconstruction, following evidence methodically. Skeptical of psychological profiling and behavioral analysis. Believes most killers are caught through legwork, not theory. Experienced interrogator who reads people well. Knows Milwaukee criminal culture intimately but finds resort town dynamics foreign - different class, different economy, different lies.

**Personality:** Cynical but not broken. The shooting rattled him more than he admits - questions whether he's losing his edge. Resents the Door County assignment as punishment disguised as "assistance." Uncomfortable in resort culture despite childhood vacations here - remembers the glamour, sees only decay now. Direct communication style, impatient with politics and PR concerns. Protective instinct toward victims even when they're already dead.

**What He Brings:** Urban homicide experience, interrogation skills, instinct for when witnesses are lying. Childhood memories of Door County's glory days give him unexpected insight into the town's desperation and the killer's possible motivations. His outsider status - neither local nor tourist - lets him see the resort culture clearly.

**Physical Description:** Six feet, solid build going soft around the middle, dark hair graying at temples, tired blue eyes. Wears cheap suits and loosened ties. Looks like what he is - city cop out of his element in resort country.

## Partner Investigator: Jessica Reeves

**Age:** 26
**Agency:** FBI Behavioral Science Unit (field assignment)
**Background:** Yale undergraduate psychology, quantitative criminology master's program at Michigan. Recruited by FBI two years ago during campus presentation. Spent two years in Quantico doing statistical analysis and case file review for BSU - the emerging "profiling" unit. This is her first actual field assignment, specifically requested because the case matches research parameters she's been studying. Grew up in suburban Connecticut, professor parents, academic household. Never fired her weapon outside qualification range.

**Investigative Approach:** Behavioral analysis and pattern recognition. Sees crimes as data sets revealing psychological frameworks. Believes understanding the killer's motivation is key to predicting behavior and identifying suspects. Methodical documentation - everything gets noted, photographed, cross-referenced. Relies heavily on BSU case studies, particularly Kemper interviews. Theoretical knowledge without field experience.

**Personality:** Brilliant and eager but green. Genuinely fascinated by criminal psychology in ways that can seem detached - discussing victim torture methods with academic interest. Conscious of being young, female, and unproven in field environment. Overcompensates with formality and credential-citing. Idealistic about FBI methodology transforming law enforcement. Doesn't understand the political pressures Callahan navigates instinctively.

**Partnership Dynamic:** Her analysis frustrates his pragmatism; his dismissiveness of behavioral science offends her training. She needs his field experience and local knowledge. He needs her federal resources and fresh perspective. Mutual respect develops slowly as her theories prove useful and his instincts prove grounded. Light tension - she's attractive, he's aware of it, both stay professional but there's chemistry neither acknowledges.

**What She Brings:** Behavioral analysis framework, FBI lab access, research on photography-obsessed killers and water disposal patterns. Her outsider perspective sees details locals miss. Her youth actually helps interviewing seasonal workers who distrust older authority.

**Physical Description:** Five-seven, slim athletic build, shoulder-length brown hair usually pulled back, brown eyes behind wire-frame glasses. Professional pantsuits and sensible shoes. Looks younger than twenty-six, which bothers her.

## Killer Profile: Tom Drexler

**Age:** 42
**Occupation:** Maintenance worker / handyman for multiple Door County resorts
**Background:** Born and raised Door County. Father Hank Drexler managed the prestigious Hotel Lakeview 1945-1972, family lived in manager's cottage on grounds. Tom grew up in resort culture's golden age - glamorous guests, full employment, community pride. Learned maintenance skills helping his father. When tourism declined in the 1960s, hotels closed one by one. Lakeview shut down 1972 when ownership corporation dissolved. Hank died six months later - heart attack, but Tom believes it was heartbreak. Tom never left Door County, works odd jobs maintaining the dying resorts, lives alone in a rented cottage near the shuttered Lakeview.

**Job Access:** Maintenance supervisor contract with Northern Hospitality Management (holding company owning five Door County properties). Has master keys to multiple resorts, does everything from plumbing to carpentry to groundskeeping. Works irregular hours, often alone in empty buildings. Resort owners barely supervise - just want minimal upkeep. Locals see him as harmless fixture. Seasonal workers don't notice him at all.

**Psychological Framework:** Complicated grief and obsessive preservation. Cannot process the resort era's death or his father's loss. Sees the seasonal workers - young, careless, partying in the ruins of what was sacred - as embodiments of everything that destroyed the resort culture. Their youth and transience represent the modern world that killed his father's dream. Photography is his attempt to "preserve" the moment before death, both of victims and of the resort buildings. The posed corpses in abandoned resort locations are grotesque memorials - freezing time before decay.

**MO Details:** Targets college-age seasonal workers, approaches as fellow resort worker offering boat parties or access to "cool abandoned buildings." Uses charm and local knowledge. Drugs victims with chloroform, photographs them alive and unaware in various resort locations. Strangles them, poses bodies, photographs again. Weights corpses and deposits in specific Lake Michigan locations where currents will eventually surface them. Keeps before/after photo sets in darkroom shrine. Four victims over June-July 1977.

**Why Caught:** Darkroom discovered in Hotel Lakeview basement during search prompted by victim photo showing identifiable location. Physical evidence, photo collection documenting all crimes, and Callahan's understanding of resort culture grief combined with Reeves's behavioral profile to identify him before he could take a fifth victim.

## Supporting Characters

**Sheriff Dale Kowalski**

Age 58, Door County Sheriff twenty-three years, born and raised local. Competent small-town law enforcement but totally outmatched by serial murder. Desperately wants investigation kept quiet - tourism economy is dying, serial killer publicity would finish it. Genuinely likes his community and fears for its survival. Provides local access and cooperation but constantly urges discretion. Married, four grown children who all left Door County for better opportunities. Drives a worn department Ford, knows every back road and local family. Resents needing outside help but respects Callahan's experience once he sees results. Political pressure from resort owners makes him cautious.

**Dr. Raymond Hayes**

Age 64, county medical examiner and general practitioner. Semi-retired physician who does ME work because county can't afford dedicated coroner. Competent but old-school - relies on visual examination and basic forensics, doesn't have access to advanced toxicology or specialized analysis. Sends samples to state lab in Madison, waits days or weeks for results. Gruff bedside manner but genuinely disturbed by the victims' youth. Provides medical details efficiently. Smokes a pipe, drives a 1968 Lincoln, maintains office in his house. Remembers the resort era's glory days, treats seasonal workers' minor injuries without judgment.

**Barbara "Barb" Henning**

Age 52, owner of Barb's Dockside Diner on the marina, key local information source. Feeds everyone - locals, seasonal workers, fishermen, investigators. Her diner is neutral territory where people talk. Knows all the resort gossip, remembers when the hotels were thriving, mourns the decline but adapts. Widow (husband drowned fishing 1973), runs diner alone, sharp observer of human nature. Likes Callahan because he reminds her of her late husband. Feeds Reeves pie and motherly advice. Provides crucial information about Tom Drexler - "Hank Drexler's boy, never got over losing the Lakeview." Knows the seasonal workers' party culture, disapproves mildly but tolerates youth.

**Amy Sullivan**

Age 21, seasonal worker at Harbor View Resort, knew all three initial victims, crucial witness. Junior at University of Wisconsin-Madison, works summers in Door County for money and beach access. Smart, observant, scared but cooperative. Describes the seasonal worker subculture - parties in abandoned hotels, drinking on private beaches, hookup culture. Remembers seeing "a maintenance guy with a camera" at several parties but didn't think anything of it - lots of people took photos. Identifies Drexler from photo lineup as "that quiet guy who fixed the pool house." Provides timeline details and social connections between victims. Worried she could have been targeted - represents the potential fifth victim saved by investigation.

**Eugene Marchek**

Age 67, owner of Hotel Lakeview (through holding company Northern Hospitality Management). Chicago-based real estate investor who bought declining Door County properties cheap in early 1970s, hoping for eventual redevelopment that hasn't materialized. Absentee landlord, visits quarterly, doesn't know maintenance staff well. Hired Drexler on previous owner's recommendation - "local guy, knows the building." Provides employment records and building access but is nervous about liability and publicity. Represents the corporate ownership that replaced family-run resort culture. Dismissive of both the victims and the town's concerns - just wants his property value protected.

## Setting Details

**Location:** Door County, Wisconsin - the "thumb" peninsula jutting into Lake Michigan between Green Bay and the lake's main body. Specifically the eastern shoreline resort row between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey's Harbor. Seventy miles of scenic coastline, limestone bluffs, small harbor towns, and once-grand lakefront resort hotels.

**Season:** Summer 1977, late June through early August. Peak tourist season, though "peak" now means half-empty hotels rather than full ones. Weather warm and humid, occasional thunderstorms rolling across Lake Michigan. Long twilights, beach weather, cherry orchards ripe. The season when seasonal workers arrive, tourists visit, and the town pretends prosperity.

**Historical Context:** Door County boomed as a resort destination 1920s-1950s - wealthy Chicagoans and Milwaukeeans summered in grand lakefront hotels. Post-WWII saw expansion, then slow decline beginning 1960s as air travel made distant destinations accessible and newer resorts offered modern amenities. By 1977, many Door County resorts have closed or operate marginally. The remaining hotels are faded and half-empty, staffed by college kids working cheap, visited by elderly guests remembering better days or young people seeking cheap lakefront access.

**Key Locations:**
- **Resort Row:** Five-mile stretch of eastern shoreline with six major hotels, three closed permanently, three operating barely. Mix of 1920s grand dames (columned porticos, ballrooms, long docks) and 1950s motor lodges.
- **Hotel Lakeview:** The crown jewel, closed 1972. Three-story limestone building with sweeping lake views, grand ballroom with crystal chandeliers (now dusty), empty pool, private beach. Drexler's darkroom is in the basement maintenance area.
- **Harbor View Resort:** Still operating, the investigation's headquarters. Fifty rooms, half occupied, seasonal workers housed in staff quarters (converted stable building). Where victims one and two worked.
- **Barb's Dockside Diner:** Marina location, wood-paneled walls covered with old resort photos, fishing tournament trophies, locals' booth versus tourists' tables. Coffee always fresh, pie cases full.
- **Sheriff's Office:** Sturgeon Bay, modest brick building, five deputies, one detective room now shared by Callahan and Reeves.
- **The Beaches:** Mix of resort private beaches (technically private, effectively abandoned, where parties happen) and public access points. Lake Michigan water cold even in summer.

**Atmosphere:** Nostalgic decay. The beauty remains - stunning lake views, summer sunsets, limestone cliffs, cherry orchards - but the prosperity is gone. Empty hotel ballrooms with peeling wallpaper. Docks with missing boards. Beach pavilions with broken windows. The seasonal workers party in these ruins, unaware of or indifferent to what they represented. Locals watch their economy die slowly. The investigation happens against this backdrop of managed decline.

**1970s Period Details:** Rotary phones in hotel rooms. No ATMs - tourists cash checks at local banks. AM radio plays Top 40 hits. Cars are big American sedans and station wagons. The Bicentennial celebration bunting still hanging faded on some buildings. No security cameras, no digital records. Seasonal workers bring transistor radios to beaches, drink Pabst and Schlitz, smoke cigarettes freely. Investigation uses carbon-copy reports, waits for film development, makes long-distance calls through operators.

## Victim Profile & Pattern

**Victim Type:** College-age seasonal workers (19-22 years old), employed at Door County resorts for summer season. Mix of genders - three female, one male. All attractive, outgoing, social. From various Wisconsin universities, working for summer money and beach access. Living in resort staff housing, participating actively in the seasonal worker party culture.

**Vulnerabilities:** Transient population with minimal local ties. Parents and friends in other cities assume they're busy working and partying. Resort employers unconcerned when workers disappear - high turnover is normal, workers often quit without notice or get fired for partying. No one monitors their comings and goings. They trust each other and local resort workers easily - Drexler is just another familiar face in the resort landscape.

**Connection:** All worked at resorts where Drexler had maintenance contracts. All participated in parties at abandoned resort locations. All were photographed by Drexler without their knowledge in the days before their deaths - at beaches, in hotel corridors, at parties. All matched his victim profile: young, careless, beautiful, representing everything that destroyed the resort culture he mourns.

**Timeline:**
- Victim 1 (female, 21): Disappeared June 18, body found July 2
- Victim 2 (female, 20): Disappeared June 29, body found July 12
- Victim 3 (male, 22): Disappeared July 8, body found July 24
- Victim 4 (female, 19): Disappeared July 19, body found July 28

**Disposal Pattern:** Drexler weighted bodies and deposited them at specific Lake Michigan locations based on his knowledge of currents - placed where they would eventually surface but not immediately. Bodies tied with rope and weighted with concrete blocks (materials from resort maintenance supplies). All eventually washed up within Door County waters, keeping the case jurisdictionally contained.

**Photography Pattern:** Each victim photographed alive and unaware (candid shots at resorts, beaches, parties) then photographed after death, posed in abandoned resort locations - ballrooms, pool houses, beach pavilions. The before/after sets document both the victim's death and the resort locations' decay. Photos are Drexler's obsessive preservation attempt.

**Why Pattern Wasn't Recognized Earlier:** Seasonal workers disappear frequently - quit jobs, get fired, leave town with new boyfriends/girlfriends. High turnover is normal. Resort owners don't track staff carefully. No centralized missing persons system for transient workers. Bodies surfacing weeks later, initially treated as separate drowning incidents until autopsy showed ligature marks and photographs were found.

## Investigation Framework

**Jurisdictional Setup:** Door County Sheriff's Department handles initial body recoveries as apparent drownings. Second body's autopsy reveals ligature marks and evidence of restraint - Sheriff Kowalski realizes he has a serial case beyond his capabilities. Requests Wisconsin State Police assistance. Simultaneously, FBI Behavioral Science Unit monitoring Midwest cases for research purposes flags the photography element as matching study parameters. Milwaukee PD "lends" Callahan to Door County (convenient exile). FBI sends Reeves (first field assignment, supervised remotely). Unusual partnership created by bureaucratic convenience, not design.

**Isolation Mechanisms:**
1. **Social:** Victims are transient seasonal workers - marginalized population that doesn't generate media attention or public outcry like local permanent residents would
2. **Economic:** Town desperately needs tourism to survive - resort owners and chamber of commerce pressure Sheriff Kowalski to keep investigation quiet, fear serial killer publicity would destroy remaining tourist business
3. **Temporal:** Weeks-long delay between disappearances and body discoveries prevented early pattern recognition, bodies initially treated as separate incidents
4. **Jurisdictional:** Sheriff wants help but wants it quiet - prefers outside investigators who will leave when case closes rather than state police presence that draws media attention

**Resources Available:** Door County Sheriff's Department (five deputies, limited investigative experience), basic medical examiner services, Wisconsin State Crime Lab in Madison (days-long turnaround for forensics), FBI lab access through Reeves (better forensics but federal bureaucracy delays). Callahan's Milwaukee PD experience and contacts. Limited budget for investigation - everything happens on small-town resources.

**Limitations:** No DNA databases, fingerprint matching requires physical card files, photo development takes days, toxicology requires sending samples to state lab and waiting weeks. No cell phones or digital communication - coordination happens through landlines and in-person meetings. No security cameras at resorts. Limited ability to track transient seasonal worker population. Pre-computerized records mean everything hand-searched.

**Community Cooperation/Resistance:** Resort owners resist investigation visibility - bad for business. Permanent locals protective of town's reputation and fearful for economy. Seasonal workers initially uncooperative (distrust authority, fear getting fired for admitting to parties in closed buildings, illegal drinking) but become cooperative once they understand the danger. The class divide between wealthy resort owners, working-class locals, and temporary college workers creates complex information-sharing dynamics.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Narrative Voice:** Third-person limited, alternating between Callahan and Reeves perspectives. Observational and grounded - documentary texture rather than purple prose. Period details integrated naturally through character observations, not forced exposition. Restrained emotional register - characters process horror professionally even when disturbed.

**Pacing Rhythm:** Methodical investigation punctuated by discovery moments. Balance between procedural legwork (interviews, evidence review, timeline building) and atmospheric exploration (abandoned resorts, beach communities, resort culture decay). Not frenetic - the 1970s investigation pace allows breathing room. Tension builds through accumulating evidence and pattern recognition, not artificial cliffhangers.

**Atmospheric Emphasis:** The resort culture decay is essential - beautiful buildings dying slowly, nostalgic sadness, economic desperation. Summer lakefront beauty contrasts with investigation darkness. The seasonal workers' careless youth against permanent residents' weary knowledge. Water omnipresent - Lake Michigan as beauty and disposal site.

**Balance:** 60% investigation (interviews, evidence, case building), 30% atmosphere and location (resort exploration, community context), 10% character moments (partnership development, personal reflections). Investigation always drives narrative but atmosphere provides essential context.

**Period Authenticity:** Technology limitations shape investigation naturally - waiting for phone calls, developing film, sending samples to labs, hand-searching records. Cultural markers subtle - music references, vehicle descriptions, casual smoking, communication formality. Pre-forensic TV era means characters don't reference crime shows or expect magic lab results.

**Avoid:** Theatrical villain speeches, melodramatic descriptions of violence, romantic subplot between investigators, hard-boiled cynicism, comic relief characters, happy ending for the town (economic decline continues regardless of solved case).

## Central Mystery Structure

**Major Clues & Placement:**
- **Ch 2:** Photographs found on/near first victim's body - establishes photography signature
- **Ch 7:** Second body confirms pattern - weighted disposal, posed, photographed
- **Ch 10:** Third victim identified retroactively - pattern now undeniable, all seasonal workers
- **Ch 14:** Maintenance worker access list emerges - someone with keys to multiple resorts
- **Ch 15:** Tom Drexler's background investigated - father's hotel, never left town
- **Ch 20:** Victim photograph shows specific location - identifiable as Hotel Lakeview
- **Ch 22:** Darkroom discovered with complete photo documentation

**Red Herrings & False Leads:**
- Resort owner with inappropriate interest in seasonal workers (Ch 13)
- Seasonal worker with photography hobby and creepy behavior (Ch 11)
- Former resort employee fired for theft, holds grudge (Ch 16)
- Boat owner who knew multiple victims (Ch 17)

**Fair Play Elements:** Reader has access to all information investigators have. Drexler appears in background of witness interviews (Ch 4, Ch 11) but isn't highlighted. Maintenance access is mentioned early (Ch 8) but among many possibilities. His photography of resort buildings is mentioned (Ch 15-16) but seems like documenting decay, not evidence of murder. The Hotel Lakeview connection is available (Ch 6 - Callahan's childhood memory of its glory) but doesn't seem significant until victim photo reveals location (Ch 20).

**Investigation Milestones:**
- Ch 2: Recognition of photography signature
- Ch 7: Pattern confirmed with second body
- Ch 10: All victims identified as seasonal workers - population established
- Ch 14: Suspect pool narrowed to maintenance workers with multi-resort access
- Ch 20: Photograph reveals specific location, focusing investigation
- Ch 22: Physical evidence (darkroom) confirms suspect
- Ch 24: Intervention before fifth victim killed

**Resolution Structure:** Discovery of darkroom with photo documentation provides physical evidence. Stakeout catches Drexler attempting fifth victim. Confrontation in Hotel Lakeview ballroom - his explanation of preservation obsession reveals motive but he's not theatrical about it. Arrest and confession fill investigative gaps. Evidence processing shows four confirmed victims, documentation of his grieving process twisted into murder. Understated ending - case solved through methodical work, town's economic problems unsolved, investigators depart having done their job.

**Satisfying Conclusion:** Killer caught before claiming fifth victim (Amy Sullivan nearly taken), solid evidence ensures prosecution, investigation method rewarded (Callahan's local knowledge + Reeves's behavioral analysis combined effectively), victims identified and families notified. But no triumph - town still dying economically, resort era still over, Drexler's grief was real even if his response was monstrous. Professional satisfaction without false uplift.
