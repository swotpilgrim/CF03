**POV:** Callahan, third-person limited
**Setting:** Door County marina, Bailey's Harbor
**Time:** Early morning, overcast July day, 1977

**Purpose:** Introduce Callahan's exile assignment, first victim discovery, and initial meeting with Reeves establishing partnership friction.

**Beats:**
- Recovery operation at marina - fishermen found body floating in Lake Michigan, Sheriff Kowalski coordinating deputies and coroner, body is young female weighted with rope and concrete blocks, been in water approximately two weeks based on decomposition
- Callahan arrives from Milwaukee for "temporary assignment" - internal punishment after shooting incident, meets Sheriff who's grateful but nervous about publicity, observes small-town department overwhelmed by what looks like homicide
- FBI analyst Jessica Reeves arrives separately from Quantico - her first field assignment, BSU sent her because case matches research parameters, awkward introduction with Callahan who's dismissive of "profilers," she's defensive about credentials and inexperience
- Key discovery during body transport - waterproof pouch in victim's clothing contains photograph of victim herself, alive and unaware, at resort location, both investigators recognize this as signature element, Sheriff realizes this isn't simple drowning
- Scene ends at dockside diner - Barb serves coffee, investigators review initial facts, tension between Callahan's pragmatism and Reeves's theoretical approach, agreement to attend autopsy together

**Dialogue Topics:** Callahan's resentment about assignment, Reeves explaining BSU interest in photography-based crimes, Sheriff's concern about tourism economy and keeping investigation quiet, jurisdictional coordination between local/federal/state agencies, procedural discussion of body recovery and evidence preservation.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan bitter about exile but professionally engaged when case proves serious; Reeves anxious about field inexperience but intellectually excited by signature evidence; mutual wariness establishing foundation for partnership.

## Chapter 2: The Photograph

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Dr. Hayes's office/autopsy room, residential building
**Time:** Mid-morning, same day

**Purpose:** Autopsy reveals homicide details and victim identity while Reeves provides behavioral context for photography signature.

**Beats:**
- Autopsy conducted by Dr. Hayes - old-school ME, semi-retired physician, reveals ligature marks on wrists/ankles indicating restraint, evidence of chloroform exposure, drowning as cause of death but clearly murder, professional weighting with concrete and marine rope
- Victim identified as Jennifer Wade, 21, University of Wisconsin student, worked at Harbor View Resort as seasonal employee, reported missing June 18 by parents, local follow-up minimal because seasonal workers often quit impulsively
- Photograph analysis - Reeves examines the image showing Jennifer at abandoned resort pool house, candid shot proving surveillance, standard Kodak paper and development, explains behavioral significance comparing to Kemper's photography compulsion
- Callahan skeptical of psychological profiling but recognizes premeditation evidence, discusses with Sheriff the transient seasonal worker population and why disappearance wasn't investigated seriously
- Discussion of next steps - interview Jennifer's coworkers at Harbor View, canvas resort properties for photography location, wait for toxicology confirmation from state lab (will take weeks), coordinate investigation structure

**Dialogue Topics:** Medical examiner's technical findings, Reeves citing BSU research on photography-obsessed killers, Callahan questioning profile utility versus evidence, Sheriff explaining seasonal worker culture and high turnover, jurisdictional authority establishment, resource limitations.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves feels pressure to prove behavioral analysis value but disturbed by first autopsy experience; appreciates victim as person not just case study; gains slight respect from Callahan when her profile proves actionable.

**Key Details:** 1970s forensic limitations (no DNA, slow toxicology), chloroform indicating planning, weighted disposal suggesting maritime knowledge, transient victim population vulnerability, resort row geography, photography equipment implications.

**POV:** Callahan, third-person limited
**Setting:** Sheriff's office conference room, then driving tour of resort row
**Time:** Afternoon, same day

**Purpose:** Establish Door County's economic desperation and political pressure to keep investigation quiet while touring the decaying resort landscape.

**Beats:**
- Sheriff's office briefing - Kowalski explains Door County tourism economy dying since 1960s, grand hotels from 1920s-50s mostly closed, summer season is economic lifeline, chamber of commerce and resort owners already pressuring for discretion, serial killer publicity would destroy remaining business
- Callahan understands political pressure from Milwaukee experience, Reeves doesn't grasp why they can't request full state police assistance and media cooperation, fundamental difference in investigative philosophy creating tension
- Driving tour of resort row - five miles of eastern shoreline with six major properties, three completely shuttered with "No Trespassing" signs, three barely operating with minimal staff and few guests, stunning natural beauty (limestone bluffs, Lake Michigan views) contrasts with human failure
- Visual details of decay - peeling paint, broken windows, overgrown grounds, empty parking lots, faded grandeur, but also glimpses of former elegance in architecture, seasonal workers visible at operating resorts in uniforms
- Callahan's childhood memory - flashback to 1950s family vacation at Hotel Lakeview when resorts were thriving, his father's pride affording the trip, understanding what's been lost and why town is desperate

**Dialogue Topics:** Sheriff explaining economic reality and political constraints, Reeves arguing for proper investigative resources, Callahan mediating between federal protocols and local politics, discussion of resort history and decline, seasonal worker population described, jurisdictional sensitivities.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's cynicism about politics mixed with unexpected nostalgia and sympathy for dying town; Reeves frustrated by constraints but beginning to understand local complexity; both recognizing investigation must balance justice and community sensitivity.

**Key Details:** 1970s small-town politics, resort architecture and geography, seasonal employment patterns, tourism economy dependence, Lake Michigan presence, summer atmosphere, period vehicles and infrastructure, class dynamics between resort owners/locals/seasonal workers.

**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Harbor View Resort staff quarters (converted stable building)
**Time:** Late afternoon, same day

**Purpose:** Interview Jennifer's coworkers to establish seasonal worker subculture and victim's background while identifying investigation challenges.

**Beats:**
- Arriving at staff quarters - converted stable behind main hotel, communal living with dozen college students, party atmosphere evidence (beer cans, music posters, casual mess), workers initially wary of investigators fearing trouble or job loss
- Reeves's youth and gender help establish rapport where Callahan's cop demeanor creates walls, workers gradually open up describing Jennifer as popular, outgoing, psychology major from Madison, dated casually, partied frequently
- Learning seasonal worker culture - work morning shifts at resort, beach afternoons, party at night exploring abandoned resort buildings and private beaches, hookup culture, minimal supervision, high turnover normalized, last saw Jennifer night of June 17 at beach party near closed resort
- Key observation from worker Amy Sullivan - "someone was always watching" feeling at parties, attributed to nosy locals or other workers, nobody remembers specific incidents but retrospective creepiness, several workers mention seeing "maintenance guy with camera" but didn't think anything unusual
- Discussion reveals transient population vulnerability - no one tracking movements closely, workers quit or get fired regularly without notice, parents assume kids are busy working, delayed recognition of disappearance, potential for other victims

**Dialogue Topics:** Jennifer's personality and social life, party locations and abandoned building exploration, dating and hookup culture, work schedules and supervision, feeling of being observed, maintenance workers and resort staff presence, other workers who quit suddenly, trust and safety assumptions.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves connects with workers' youth while recognizing their vulnerability; maternal protectiveness emerges; realizes victims are like her younger self; growing determination to catch killer before more die.

**POV:** Callahan, third-person limited
**Setting:** Makeshift investigation office in Harbor View closed dining room
**Time:** Evening, same day

**Purpose:** Reeves presents formal behavioral profile based on evidence while establishing investigative framework and partnership dynamic.

**Beats:**
- Investigation office setup - hotel's closed dining room repurposed with folding tables, evidence photos, typewriter, file boxes, coffee maker, Reeves has prepared typed behavioral analysis report with carbon copies
- Profile presentation - photography obsession as signature indicating preservation/control compulsion, references Edmund Kemper BSU interviews, candid photos suggest surveillance period, chloroform indicates planning and chemical knowledge, water disposal shows Lake Michigan comfort and current understanding, likely boat access or maritime background
- Callahan challenges profile utility - notes half of Door County owns boats and knows the lake, questions how profile narrows suspect pool versus just describing crime, Reeves counters that combined factors (resort access, seasonal worker contact, photography equipment, maritime knowledge) significantly narrow possibilities
- Sheriff worried about how many people still fit profile, discussion of investigation isolation advantages for killer: transient victims not missed immediately, delayed body discovery, community resistance to publicity, limited resources, slow forensic processing
- Radio call interrupts - second body reported, recovery operation scheduled for dawn, all three investigators realize pattern confirmation likely, Reeves insists surveillance period for next potential victim, Callahan wants to identify victim pool first

**Dialogue Topics:** Behavioral profile technical details, Kemper case comparisons, photography paraphilia explanation, disposal pattern analysis, suspect pool narrowing logic, political constraints on investigation, resource allocation discussion, jurisdictional coordination, forensic timeline expectations (weeks for lab results).

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's skepticism toward profiling challenged by Reeves's intelligence and logic; growing respect despite personality clash; both frustrated by constraints but united by professional commitment; tension before second body discovery.

**Setting:** Harbor View Resort bar
**Time:** Night, same day

**Purpose:** Provide Callahan's backstory, emotional depth, and childhood resort memories while subtly introducing Drexler's name in context.

**Beats:**
- Alone at hotel bar - small operation still running for handful of elderly guests, Callahan nursing whiskey, processing the case and his own exile, bartender is elderly local who remembers glory days
- Reflection on shooting incident - three months ago in Milwaukee, sixteen-year-old kid with gun during convenience store robbery, justified shooting but age haunts him, department-mandated counseling, "temporary assignment" as punishment disguised as assistance
- Self-doubt questions - is he losing his edge, did he hesitate or act too fast, does he still trust his instincts, anger about exile mixed with questioning whether he deserves it, divorced two years and drinking more than he should
- Childhood memory flashback - 1957 family vacation to Hotel Lakeview, his father (machinist) saving all year to afford one week, the glamour from working-class perspective (marble lobby, uniformed staff, fancy dining, private beach), father's pride in accessing American dream
- Present reflection - seeing decay of what was sacred to previous generation, young people partying carelessly in ruins, symbolic dimension to case beyond catching killer, understanding town's grief watching their identity die
- Bartender conversation - shares own glory days memories, mentions casually "Tom Drexler's father Hank managed the Lakeview, it killed Hank when they closed it in '72," Callahan files the name unconsciously, first mention not highlighted

**Dialogue Topics:** Bartender's resort history stories, Callahan deflecting personal questions, brief exchanges with other bar patrons about tourism decline, bartender recognizing Callahan as former childhood visitor, shared nostalgia for 1950s era, casual mention of local families affected by closures.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's cynicism masks deep grief and self-doubt; connecting personally to location's loss mirrors his own career crisis; nostalgia for childhood innocence and American dream accessibility; determination to solve case as redemption attempt.

**Setting:** Abandoned salmon cannery, Miller's Point
**Time:** Dawn, next day

**Purpose:** Second victim discovery confirms serial pattern and escalates investigation urgency while revealing killer's methodology consistency.

**Beats:**
- Dawn body recovery - fishermen spotted body near shore by old cannery, crime scene team processing, body is male, 22, similar weighted disposal with rope and concrete, approximately ten days in water, ligature marks visible
- Victim identified quickly as Brian Kohler, worked at Bayside Resort (different from Jennifer's), reported missing June 29, again assumed he quit without notice, parents filed report but minimal follow-up
- Dr. Hayes conducts preliminary examination on-site - same ligature patterns indicating restraint, chloroform smell still faint, professional quality knots and weighting suggesting maritime knowledge or military training, drowning cause of death
- Critical discovery - waterproof pouch with photograph found, shows Brian at different resort location (appears to be ballroom interior), candid shot while unaware, same photography signature as Jennifer
- Pattern confirmation discussion - Reeves explains behavioral significance of consistency (surveillance, photography, chloroform abduction, restraint, drowning, weighted disposal, posed with own photo), Sheriff visibly shaken recognizing serial predator, media containment becomes harder with two bodies
- Evidence coordination - photograph will take two days to develop and enhance at Madison lab, no digital comparison possible, need to physically identify locations, both photos show abandoned resort settings confirming killer's geographic focus

**Dialogue Topics:** Medical examiner's technical findings, victim identification and background, resort employment connections, photography pattern analysis, disposal method consistency, maritime knowledge implications, investigation coordination between agencies, media management strategy, next investigative steps prioritization.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves's clinical analysis masks growing horror at pattern's implications; male victim disrupts some profile assumptions but confirms predator's scope; pressure to prove behavioral science value increases; protective instinct toward potential future victims intensifies.

**Key Details:** Abandoned cannery atmosphere (rust, decay, graffiti, Lake Michigan waves), 1970s crime scene processing (film photography, evidence bags, manual measurements), forensic timeline constraints, male victim expanding profile, different resort connection, ten-day interval between disappearances, weighted disposal professionalism.

## Chapter 8: Canvas Resort Row

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Callahan, third-person limited
**Setting:** Six resort properties along eastern Door County shoreline
**Time:** Mid-morning, second day

**Purpose:** Systematic investigation of resort properties establishes access patterns and suspect pool while documenting atmospheric decay.

**Beats:**
- Systematic property visits - Callahan and Reeves tour all six major resort locations assessing security, access, maintenance, and staffing, three closed resorts have minimal security (signs but no fences, locks broken by vandals, windows smashed), seasonal workers confirm regular parties in these buildings
- Three operating resorts (Harbor View, Bayside, Shoreline Inn) employ skeleton staff, rely heavily on maintenance contractors for all repairs and upkeep, managers complain about budget constraints and declining occupancy
- Meeting owners and managers - mix of absentee landlords like Eugene Marchek (owns Lakeview through holding company Northern Hospitality Management) and struggling local families trying to keep businesses alive, everyone mentions maintenance challenges
- Access pattern documentation - maintenance workers have master keys to multiple properties, seasonal workers know how to bypass closed building security, boat owners can access private beaches from water, locals know properties from decades of familiarity, suspect pool is enormous
- Focus on cross-property access - who had legitimate reason to be at both Harbor View (Jennifer's workplace) and Bayside (Brian's workplace), compile list of shared contractors and maintenance workers, twenty-three names total including Tom Drexler

**Dialogue Topics:** Property security and access protocols, maintenance contractor arrangements, seasonal worker supervision levels, resort ownership structures, financial struggles and business decisions, abandoned building condition, vandalism and trespass issues, local knowledge of properties, employment record access.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's systematic cop methodology finding rhythm; appreciation for Reeves's organized note-taking; shared frustration at enormous suspect pool; visual impact of decay affecting both investigators differently (his nostalgia, her analytical observation).

**Key Details:** 1970s property management (minimal security technology, physical key systems, paper employment records), resort architecture variety (1920s grand hotels, 1950s motor lodges), Lake Michigan beach access, driving investigation in Sheriff's department Ford, handwritten notes and lists, summer heat and tourism season atmosphere, period communication (must visit in person, no cell phones).

## Chapter 9: Third Victim Identified

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Sheriff's office records room, then county morgue
**Time:** Afternoon, second day

**Purpose:** Third victim discovery through records review confirms pattern's timeline and escalates urgency while establishing investigative methodology.

**Beats:**
- Records review - cross-referencing missing person reports with body recoveries, Reeves's systematic approach finds Laura Simmons, 20, worked at Shoreline Inn, reported missing July 8 by parents from Appleton, body recovered July 24 initially processed as drowning without autopsy
- Dr. Hayes reviews the drowning file - realizes mistake, orders immediate exhumation, body only two weeks buried so evidence should be preserved, expedited exhumation happens same day with court order
- Exhumation and re-autopsy - confirms ligature marks, chloroform exposure, weighted disposal, same pattern as Jennifer and Brian, waterproof pouch with photograph found during clothing re-examination, shows Laura at beach pavilion location, candid and unaware
- Timeline establishment - June 18 (Jennifer disappears), June 29 (Brian disappears), July 8 (Laura disappears), roughly ten-day intervals suggesting cooling-off period, if pattern holds someone disappeared July 18-20, body will surface soon
- Victim notification - Callahan handles calls to parents explaining their daughter was murdered not drowned, emotionally draining, Reeves observes his compassion and humanity beneath cynicism, families devastated but grateful for truth and justice pursuit
- Investigation implications - three confirmed victims from three different resorts, all seasonal workers, all photographed in abandoned resort locations, transient population tracking difficulty, potential for other victims not yet discovered

**Dialogue Topics:** Missing person report details, drowning versus homicide indicators, exhumation legal procedures, autopsy findings comparison, timeline pattern discussion, cooling-off period behavioral significance, parent notification approach, victim background information, employment connections between resorts, investigation resource needs.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves's analytical satisfaction at finding pattern mixed with horror at third victim confirmation; witnessing Callahan's emotional labor with families deepens her respect; growing fear about timeline prediction and potential fourth victim; determination intensifying.

**Key Details:** 1970s record systems (paper files, manual cross-referencing), exhumation procedures, forensic preservation after burial, rotary phone parent notifications, three separate resort employment locations, ten-day interval pattern, beach pavilion as photography location, transient population documentation challenges.

**Purpose:** Consolidate evidence into clear pattern recognition and establish investigative direction while introducing potential fourth victim.

**Beats:**
- Investigation wall assembly - photos, maps, timelines pinned to cork boards, three victims' faces displayed, evidence documentation organized, Reeves has created detailed timeline and geographic charts, Callahan contributes street cop observations
- Victimology summary - all seasonal workers from different resorts but overlapping social circles, all attractive and outgoing, all active in party scene at abandoned buildings, didn't know each other well but moved in same youth culture
- Photography analysis - three different abandoned resort locations (pool house, ballroom, beach pavilion), all at closed properties within five-mile resort row, victims photographed alive and unaware before abduction, suggests killer interacted casually first
- Geographic pattern mapping - all bodies recovered along eastern Door County shoreline, disposal sites suggest knowledge of specific Lake Michigan currents, weighted placement deliberate to ensure eventual surfacing, killer comfortable on water
- Suspect pool narrowing discussion - must be local with resort access, photography equipment and developing capability (no photo shops report suspicious requests means private darkroom), maritime knowledge, contact with seasonal workers, can move around without suspicion
- Interruption - Amy Sullivan's roommate reports Sarah hasn't been seen since July 19, fits timeline pattern perfectly, all three investigators realize fourth victim likely taken, race against body discovery begins

**Dialogue Topics:** Evidence synthesis and pattern analysis, victimology common factors, photography locations and access, Lake Michigan geography and currents, suspect profile refinement, darkroom capability implications, investigation next steps prioritization, timeline prediction discussion, fourth victim potential and urgency.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan and Reeves working in sync for first time, mutual respect emerging through collaborative analysis, shared frustration at being behind killer's timeline, determination mixed with dread, professional partnership solidifying under pressure.

**Key Details:** 1970s investigation visual tools (cork boards, pins, hand-drawn maps, Polaroid evidence photos), coffee and late-night work atmosphere, resort row five-mile geography, Lake Michigan eastern shoreline, timeline intervals, darkroom location question, fourth victim name (Sarah) introduced, summer night setting.

**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Abandoned Hotel Lakeview and grounds
**Time:** Morning, third day

**Purpose:** Physical exploration of abandoned resort reveals atmospheric decay and investigation clues while Amy Sullivan provides insider witness perspective.

**Beats:**
- Systematic exploration begins - Hotel Lakeview chosen first as largest and most decayed property, Deputy escorts for safety, three-story limestone building with broken windows, Reeves experiences visceral impact of faded grandeur
- Interior documentation - grand ballroom where wealthy Chicagoans danced 1940s-50s now has water damage and graffiti, crystal chandeliers dusty with pieces missing, peeling wallpaper, rotted carpet, pool house with cracked tiles and algae-filled pool, beach pavilion with structural damage
- Evidence of recent activity - beer cans, cigarette butts, sleeping bags, condom wrappers throughout property, seasonal workers use these spaces regularly for parties and hookups, sense of being watched in empty corridors
- Photography location identified - Reeves matches pool house corner to Jennifer's photograph using distinctive tile pattern, killer brought victim here casually before later abduction, confirms surveillance period theory
- Amy Sullivan volunteers assistance - she knew all three victims, terrified but wants to help find Sarah, describes party culture and maintenance worker presence, "there was always this maintenance guy around, but we never paid attention - just part of the scenery," can't describe him clearly (middle-aged, quiet, had camera sometimes)
- Critical discovery - Sarah's backpack found hidden in ballroom closet, confirms she was here recently, personal items inside, no phone or wallet, killer took her from this building

**Dialogue Topics:** Architectural details and decay description, seasonal worker party culture and building access, Amy's memories of victims and social dynamics, maintenance worker observations, photography and camera presence normalized, safety concerns and creepy atmosphere, evidence significance discussion, search coordination.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves disturbed by atmospheric decay and sense of malevolence in beautiful ruins; protective feelings toward Amy; horror at finding Sarah's backpack confirming active abduction; determination to prevent fifth victim.

## Chapter 12: Records Search

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Callahan, third-person limited
**Setting:** County courthouse basement records room
**Time:** Afternoon, third day

**Purpose:** Manual records search narrows suspect pool to key names including Drexler while building investigative tension.

**Beats:**
- Courthouse basement access - county clerk Helen Moffett initially resistant citing privacy concerns and warrant requirements, Reeves mentions federal jurisdiction, clerk relents grudgingly and points them to filing section then leaves, hours of manual sorting ahead
- Systematic record search - boxes of handwritten employment cards, typed records, carbon copies from 1975-1980, no computer database so everything physically compared across different filing systems, Callahan and Reeves divide labor
- Cross-referencing process - identify twenty-three men who worked multiple resort properties during relevant period, narrow to seven who worked all three victims' resorts (Harbor View, Bayside, Shoreline Inn), further narrow to four who appear in closed property maintenance records
- Maritime knowledge filter - cross-reference remaining names with boat registrations and fishing licenses, two names emerge: Leonard Watts (47, maintenance supervisor) and Tom Drexler (42, handyman), Callahan remembers bartender's casual mention of Drexler
- Interrupted by Sheriff's call - Sarah's body found in Lake Michigan off Cana Island, same pattern confirmed (weighted, posed, photographed), fourth victim, photograph shows her in Hotel Lakeview (same building where they found backpack hours earlier)
- Background checks requested - need full histories on Watts and Drexler before interviews, Reeves wants immediate action, Callahan wants information first, tension over investigative pace, background check results: Drexler's father died 1972 six months after Lakeview closed

**Dialogue Topics:** Records access and legal requirements, employment card information and cross-referencing methodology, suspect pool narrowing logic, maritime knowledge indicators, Drexler family history mentioned, investigative pace debate, evidence coordination with body discovery, photograph location significance, next steps discussion.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's methodical approach finding results creates satisfaction mixed with urgency; frustration at being behind killer (fourth victim already taken before they narrowed suspects); determination to prevent fifth victim; respect for Reeves's systematic mind.

**Key Details:** County courthouse basement atmosphere (dust, fluorescent lights, file boxes, musty paper smell), 1970s manual record systems, handwritten employment cards, carbon copies, payphone for calls, hours of physical searching, two suspect names emerging, Drexler's father's death timing, fourth body confirming timeline pattern.

## Chapter 13: False Lead

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Harbor View Resort maintenance area, then Leonard Watts's apartment
**Time:** Morning, fourth day

**Purpose:** Interview Leonard Watts as prime suspect reveals red herring while teaching investigative caution and misdirection.

**Beats:**
- Initial interview - find Leonard Watts repairing plumbing at Harbor View, he's immediately cooperative and even eager to help, admits working multiple resorts with master key access, knows all properties intimately, grew up in Milwaukee, moved to Door County fifteen years ago
- Background volunteered - divorced, lives alone, loves fishing (emphasizes this), talks freely about knowing victims as "nice kids, shame what happened," too cooperative for Callahan's instincts, Reeves notes rehearsed quality to his ease
- Photography admission - when asked, Watts readily admits taking landscape photos and having basement darkroom, claims he documents resort decay for nostalgia (came to Door County on honeymoon 1962, loves area's history), offers to show them immediately
- Apartment visit - basement darkroom revealed with landscape photography of resort buildings at sunset, nature shots, beach scenes, no people photography, no victims, nothing incriminating, basic hobby-level equipment, seems transparent
- Alibi provision - Watts provides detailed alibis for victim disappearance dates including documented work assignments and some witness verification, Sheriff runs deeper background check finding no criminal record, no complaints, references check out
- Surveillance debate - Reeves still suspicious of how perfectly cooperative he is, wants surveillance, Callahan's gut says wrong guy (too obvious, too eager), compromise on loose surveillance while investigating Drexler, Watts casually asks "Have you talked to that Drexler guy who's always lurking around the old Lakeview?"

**Dialogue Topics:** Watts's resort work history and access, fishing and maritime knowledge, divorce and personal history, photography hobby explanation, victims' descriptions and interactions, alibi details, darkroom tour and equipment discussion, investigative suspicion and cooperation, Drexler's name mentioned as deflection or genuine observation.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves's suspicion battles with lack of evidence; learning that obvious suspects can be misleading; frustration at losing time on wrong person; appreciation for Callahan's instinct-based skepticism complementing her analytical approach.

**Key Details:** Harbor View maintenance area (tools, plumbing supplies, resort infrastructure), Watts's apartment basement darkroom, landscape photography portfolio, 1970s photo developing equipment, alibi documentation, fishing references, Milwaukee background, fifteen-year Door County residency, Drexler's name planted as potential deflection.

- Drexler family story - Tom grew up embedded in resort culture during golden age (1950s-60s), learned maintenance skills helping his father, never left Door County or showed interest in other life, witnessed resort decline through 1960s as tourism shifted
- Hotel closure impact - corporate ownership bought Lakeview 1968, kept Hank as manager but cut budgets progressively, closed permanently 1972 when corporation dissolved, Hank died of heart attack six months later (Barb believes heartbreak killed him), Tom never recovered from dual loss
- Current life details - lives alone in rented cottage near Lakeview property, works odd maintenance jobs for various resorts, seems stuck in past, "harmless but sad" in Barb's assessment, never married, few friends, keeps to himself
- Photography observation - Barb has seen Tom photographing old resort buildings assuming he's documenting memories like many nostalgic locals do, Sheriff adds official background: no criminal record but two dismissed "odd behavior" reports (1974: lingering at seasonal workers' beach party; 1976: found in closed resort after hours claiming vandalism check)
- Employment confirmation - current contractor for Northern Hospitality Management (Eugene Marchek's holding company owning Lakeview and four other properties), has master keys to all five, legitimate access to every location in investigation

**Dialogue Topics:** Drexler family history and legacy, Hotel Lakeview's glory days and decline, Hank Drexler's death and Tom's grief, local community observations of Tom's behavior, photography activities, maintenance work scope, odd behavior reports and explanations, resort closure economic impact, nostalgia and stuck-in-past assessment.

**Emotional Arc:** Callahan's sympathy for Drexler's loss and grief while recognizing potential psychological break; understanding how trauma can twist into violence; personal resonance with being trapped by past (his own shooting incident); determination tempered by compassion.
