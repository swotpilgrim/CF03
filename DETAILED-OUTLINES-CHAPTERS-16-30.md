# DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES: The Resort (Chapters 16-30)

## Chapter 16: The Warrant Problem

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Reeves, third-person limited
**Setting:** Sheriff's office, legal consultation room
**Time:** Morning, fifth day

**Purpose:** Legal constraints prevent immediate action on Drexler despite strong circumstantial evidence, creating investigative frustration.

**Beats:**
- Evidence presentation - Callahan and Reeves present surveillance findings to Sheriff Kowalski and county attorney: Drexler's employment access to all victim locations, family connection to Hotel Lakeview, background odd behavior reports, nighttime visits to crime scenes with camera equipment
- Legal insufficiency - county attorney explains circumstantial evidence isn't enough for search warrant, behavior could be explained as nostalgia or legitimate property maintenance, need physical evidence or witness identification or clear probable cause
- Strategic debate - Callahan wants direct interview to pressure Drexler and see if he breaks or makes mistakes, Reeves opposes arguing he'll lawyer up or trigger violence/flight if he's the killer, Sheriff caught between paralysis and community safety
- Compromise approach - continue surveillance, interview people who know Drexler building circumstantial case, re-interview seasonal workers with Drexler's photo for identification, seek concrete evidence while monitoring his movements
- Deputy assigned background interviews - coworkers, landlord, anyone with Drexler knowledge, meanwhile Callahan and Reeves will show his photo to seasonal workers, Amy Sullivan tentatively identifies him as "guy who was around sometimes, had camera, fixed stuff"

**Dialogue Topics:** Legal warrant requirements and probable cause standards, circumstantial versus physical evidence, interview strategy debate, surveillance continuation logistics, witness identification procedures, political pressure on Sheriff, investigative resource allocation, timeline urgency with potential fifth victim.

**Emotional Arc:** Reeves frustrated by legal constraints when behaviorally certain of Drexler's guilt; learning field reality differs from academic theory; growing respect for Callahan's navigation of legal and practical limitations.

**Key Details:** 1970s legal standards (no digital surveillance, warrant requirements strict), county attorney's office procedures, driver's license photo used for identification, Amy Sullivan's tentative recognition, surveillance continuation approved, political pressure mounting, summer investigation heat.

**Beats:**
- Owners' meeting - Sheriff's request brings Eugene Marchek (Lakeview owner) and three other resort property owners plus chamber of commerce president, demand investigation update while insisting on media blackout
- Economic desperation - tourist season half over, occupancy down, serial killer publicity would destroy remaining business permanently, three more resorts planning permanent closure after season, industry dying regardless of murders
- Marchek's aggression - threatens to pull cooperation, claims investigators harassing his maintenance staff (Drexler), absentee landlord who barely knows employees but protecting property value, nearly causes Callahan to reveal Drexler as suspect before Reeves intervenes diplomatically
- Diplomatic resolution - Reeves explains investigation progress without naming suspects, requests continued property access, asks owners to report unusual activity, they agree grudgingly prioritizing economic survival over justice
- Private conversation - after meeting, Marchek admits minimal Drexler oversight, provides employment records showing access to all five Northern Hospitality properties since 1973, mentions Drexler refused payment increase last year saying "doesn't do it for money, does it for the resorts"

**Dialogue Topics:** Tourism economy statistics and decline, media management and publicity blackout, investigation progress updates (vague), property access and cooperation, maintenance staff employment and supervision, economic impact of murders versus investigation visibility, resort closure decisions, chamber of commerce concerns, Drexler's employment history and compensation.

- Profile details - male 35-50, local with deep resort culture connection, personal loss connected to tourism decline, employment provides legitimate victim/location access, photography obsession indicates preservation/control need, victim selection shows rage toward youth/transience, water disposal suggests Lake Michigan comfort and possible symbolic cleansing
- Motivational analysis - grief converted to violence, victims symbolize what destroyed his world, creating memorial through photography and murder, preserving moment before death (both victims' and resorts'), highly organized, familiar with investigation procedures, will continue until caught or significant life stressor
- Drexler fit discussion - Reeves argues profile matches perfectly (father's death linked to Lakeview closure, maintenance access, photography documented, victims represent careless youth), Callahan agrees but notes profile could fit others, need physical evidence not just behavioral match
- Strategic debate - announce fourth victim publicly to create pressure, interview Drexler formally for confrontation, or maintain surveillance waiting for mistake, Sheriff wants patience, Callahan wants confrontation, Reeves wants more behavioral evidence, Deputy calls - Drexler didn't come home tonight, truck not at cottage

- Symbolic thinking - Callahan considers where Drexler would take final victim for perfect preservation photograph, most meaningful resort location for completion, Reeves suggests Lakeview ballroom where his father presided during glory days and where Sarah was killed
- Ballroom already searched - but Callahan remembers upper balcony overlooking dance floor, access closed off for safety decades ago, perfect elevated photography position with symbolic view of father's domain, service stairs provide access

**Beats:**
- Reeves at Quantico - briefing BSU supervisors on case, field performance praised, behavioral profile validated, assigned to next case (different location, different murders), reflects on Door County as formative experience changing her from academic to field investigator
- Reeves's transformation - violence is real not academic, victims are people not data sets, field work requires emotional processing not just analysis, more confident but less certain, keeps Callahan's contact number in desk drawer
- Callahan in Milwaukee - Internal Affairs review of shooting incident, Door County performance counted as rehabilitation evidence, committee decides active duty return with mandatory continued counseling, relief mixed with doubt about continuing career
