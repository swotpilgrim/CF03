# THE RESORT - MASTER OUTLINE

## ACT 1: ARRIVAL & DISCOVERY (Chapters 1-10)

### Chapter 1: Body in the Water

Early morning, Door County marina, overcast July sky. Deputy radios Sheriff Kowalski - fishermen found body in Lake Michigan off Bailey's Harbor. Recovery operation underway. Body is young female, weighted with rope and concrete, been in water approximately two weeks based on condition. Detective Mike Callahan arrives from Milwaukee, reassigned to "assist" Door County - internal exile after shooting incident. Meets Sheriff Kowalski who's grateful but nervous about outside help. Body bag loaded into coroner's van. FBI analyst Jessica Reeves arrives separately, first field assignment from Behavioral Science Unit. Awkward introduction at marina - Callahan dismissive of "profilers," Reeves defensive about credentials. Both notice something in victim's clothing - waterproof pouch with photograph of the victim herself, alive and unaware, at a resort location. Period atmosphere: rotary phone calls, carbon-copy incident reports, morning coffee at dockside diner. Investigation begins with unsettling signature element.

### Chapter 2: The Photograph

Mid-morning, county medical examiner's office in Dr. Hayes's house. Autopsy reveals victim drowned but shows ligature marks on wrists and ankles - was restrained before death. Evidence of chloroform exposure. Body weighted professionally with concrete blocks and marine rope. Estimated two weeks in water. Dr. Hayes, old-school ME, provides details efficiently while smoking pipe. The photograph is key focus - developed on standard Kodak paper, shows victim (identified as Jennifer Wade, 21, University of Wisconsin) at what appears to be an abandoned resort pool house, candid shot, unaware of photographer. Reeves explains behavioral significance - photography obsession suggests Kemper-style trophy collection, documentation compulsion. Callahan skeptical but notes the photo proves premeditation and victim surveillance. Sheriff Kowalski provides background: Jennifer worked at Harbor View Resort, reported missing June 18, assumed she quit without notice - common with seasonal workers. Parents filed missing person report from Madison but limited follow-up. First investigative thread: who had access to photograph her without her knowledge?

### Chapter 3: Resort Town Politics

Afternoon, Sheriff's office conference room, Sturgeon Bay. Sheriff Kowalski briefs investigators on Door County's economic reality and political pressures. Resort tourism is dying - grand hotels from 1920s-50s mostly closed or operating at fraction of capacity. Town desperate to maintain summer tourist season - it's their economic lifeline. Chamber of commerce and resort owners already calling, worried about investigation visibility. Serial killer publicity would destroy remaining business. Kowalski wants case solved but quietly. Callahan understands political pressure from Milwaukee experience. Reeves doesn't grasp why they can't just request state police resources and media assistance in identifying killer. Tension over investigative approach. They tour resort row - five miles of lakefront with six major properties, three completely closed, three barely operating. Beautiful limestone bluffs, stunning lake views, but faded grandeur everywhere. Peeling paint, empty parking lots, "No Trespassing" signs on shuttered buildings. Seasonal workers visible at operating resorts - college-age kids in resort uniforms. The contrast between natural beauty and economic decay is stark. Callahan remembers childhood vacations here in the 1950s - glamorous, bustling, alive. Now feels like managed decline.

### Chapter 4: Seasonal Worker Culture

Late afternoon, Harbor View Resort staff quarters. Interview Jennifer Wade's coworkers - dozen college students working summer season for money and beach access. Living in converted stable building behind main hotel, communal atmosphere, party culture. They're wary of investigators initially, afraid of getting fired or in trouble. Reeves's youth helps establish rapport. Workers describe Jennifer: outgoing, popular, from Madison, psychology major, dated casually, partied hard. Last seen night of June 17 at beach party near closed resort. Assumed she hooked up with someone or quit impulsively - neither unusual. Workers describe their culture: work morning shifts, beach afternoons, party at night. They explore abandoned resort buildings, drink at private beaches technically off-limits, hook up casually. "Someone was always watching" - they felt observed but attributed it to nosy locals or other workers. Nobody remembers specific creepy incidents with Jennifer. Callahan notes the transient population's vulnerability - no one tracking their movements, high turnover normalized, minimal supervision. Period details: transistor radios, Pabst beer cans, casual marijuana references, rotary phone in staff quarters for emergencies only. Reeves sees victim pool - young, transient, unsupervised. Ending: worker mentions "we still party at the old Lakeview sometimes - it's got the best ballroom."

### Chapter 5: Behavioral Analysis

Evening, makeshift investigation office in Harbor View Resort's closed dining room. Reeves presents behavioral analysis to Callahan and Sheriff Kowalski using case files from FBI research. Photography obsession is signature element - compulsion to document victims suggests psychological need for preservation, control, or reliving the crimes. References Edmund Kemper interviews - photography of victims before and after death indicates specific paraphilia. The candid nature of photo (victim unaware) suggests surveillance period before abduction. Chloroform indicates planning and some medical or chemical knowledge. Water disposal shows comfort with Lake Michigan, understanding of currents and weight requirements - possibly boat owner, fisherman, or marina worker. Callahan challenges the profile - half of Door County owns boats and knows the lake. Reeves counters that combined with resort access and seasonal worker contact, the profile narrows significantly. Sheriff worried about how many people fit the profile. They discuss isolation advantages for killer: transient victims, delayed discovery, community resistance to investigation visibility, limited resources. Period texture: typewritten profile pages, carbon copies, evidence photos in manila folders, coffee in Styrofoam cups. Relationship dynamic: Reeves's academic approach versus Callahan's street cop pragmatism, mutual frustration but beginning respect. Ending: second body report comes through radio - another recovery operation at dawn.

### Chapter 6: Callahan's Memory

Night, Callahan alone at Harbor View Resort bar (still operating for handful of guests). Nursing whiskey, processing the case and his own situation. Reflects on shooting incident three months ago - sixteen-year-old kid with gun, justified shooting, but haunts him. Milwaukee PD's "temporary reassignment" is punishment disguised as assistance. He's angry about exile but also questioning whether he's losing his edge. Door County feels foreign despite childhood memories. Flashback to 1957 family vacation - his father saving money all year to bring family to Hotel Lakeview for one week. The glamour from a working-class kid's perspective: marble lobby, uniformed staff, fancy dining room, private beach. His father proud to afford it. The resort culture represented success, aspiration, American dream accessible. Now sees the decay and understands the town's desperation - they're watching their dream die. Thinks about the victims - young people partying carelessly in ruins of what was sacred to previous generation. Symbolic dimension to the case beyond just catching a killer. Bartender (elderly local) recognizes Callahan stayed here as kid, shares own memories of glory days. "Tom Drexler's father managed the Lakeview - it killed Hank when they closed it." First mention of Drexler, not highlighted, just local history. Period atmosphere: wood-paneled bar, AM radio playing soft rock, cigarette smoke, rotary phone behind bar.

### Chapter 7: Second Victim

Dawn, abandoned salmon cannery on Miller's Point. Second body recovery - fishermen spotted it near shore. Crime scene team processing. Body is male, 22, similar weighted disposal pattern with rope and concrete. Been in water approximately ten days. Same ligature marks indicating restraint, evidence of chloroform. Victim identified quickly as Brian Kohler, worked at Bayside Resort (different from Jennifer's workplace), reported missing June 29, again assumed he quit without notice. Callahan and Reeves examine body positioning before removal - staged, deliberate placement. Dr. Hayes notes professional quality of knots and weighting - suggests maritime knowledge or military background. The key discovery: another waterproof pouch with photograph. This shows Brian at different resort location - appears to be inside an abandoned building, maybe a ballroom, candid shot, unaware. Reeves confirms pattern: surveillance, photography, chloroform abduction, restraint, drowning, weighted disposal, posed with their own photograph. Sheriff Kowalski visibly shaken - one body could be isolated incident, two confirms serial predator. Discussion of media containment becomes harder. Period details: developing the photograph takes two days (send to lab in Madison), evidence logging with carbon copies, no way to digitally compare images. Relationship moment: Reeves's clinical analysis of staging upsets Kowalski; Callahan translates into less academic language. Ending: both photographs show abandoned resort locations - killer is using closed buildings.

### Chapter 8: Canvas Resort Row

Mid-morning, systematic canvas of resort properties. Callahan and Reeves visit all six major resort locations to assess access, security, and maintenance. Three closed resorts (including Hotel Lakeview) have minimal security - "No Trespassing" signs but no fences, locks easily bypassed, windows broken by vandals. Seasonal workers confirm they party in these buildings regularly. Three operating resorts (Harbor View, Bayside, Shoreline Inn) employ minimal staff, rely on maintenance contractors for repairs. Meet various resort managers and owners - mix of absentee landlords (like Eugene Marchek who owns Lakeview through holding company) and struggling local families trying to keep businesses alive. Everyone mentions maintenance issues - plumbing, electrical, groundskeeping. Several resorts share contractors to save money. Reeves catalogs access points: maintenance workers have keys to multiple properties, seasonal workers know how to enter closed buildings, boat owners can access private beaches from water, locals know the properties from decades of familiarity. Suspect pool is enormous. Callahan focuses on who would have access to both victims at different resorts. Period atmosphere: driving county roads in Sheriff's department Ford, handwritten notes, visiting properties in person since can't call ahead to closed buildings. The visual decay is everywhere - peeling paint, overgrown grounds, empty pools, broken docks. Ending: they compile list of shared contractors and maintenance workers - twenty-three names.

### Chapter 9: Third Victim Identified

Afternoon, Sheriff's office, records review. Cross-referencing missing person reports with body recoveries reveals third potential victim. Laura Simmons, 20, worked at Shoreline Inn, reported missing July 8 by parents from Appleton. Body recovered from Lake Michigan July 24, initially processed as drowning - no autopsy ordered because seemed like swimming accident. Dr. Hayes reviews the case file, orders body exhumed. Exhumation happens quickly (body only two weeks buried). Autopsy confirms: ligature marks, chloroform exposure, weighted disposal, same pattern. Waterproof pouch with photograph found in clothing during re-examination - shows Laura at yet another abandoned resort location, beach pavilion setting, candid and unaware. Three confirmed victims, same MO throughout. Timeline: June 18 (Jennifer disappears), June 29 (Brian disappears), July 8 (Laura disappears) - roughly ten-day intervals. Sheriff terrified of fourth victim timeline - if pattern holds, someone disappeared around July 18-20, body will surface soon. Reeves notes the interval suggests cooling-off period but also suggests compulsion won't stop. Callahan wants to interview all seasonal workers who knew any victim - looking for connection points. Period details: paper file systems, physical cross-referencing, calling parents on rotary phones to inform them their daughter was murdered not drowned. The emotional weight of notifications. Relationship: Reeves observes Callahan's compassion during parent calls, sees beyond his cynicism. Ending: pattern undeniable - all seasonal workers, all photographed, all drowned and weighted.

### Chapter 10: Pattern Recognition

Evening, investigation office, wall covered with photos, maps, timelines. Three victims confirmed, all seasonal workers from different resorts but all active in the party scene at abandoned buildings. The photographs show different locations: pool house, ballroom, beach pavilion - all at closed resort properties. Victims didn't know each other well but moved in overlapping social circles. All attractive, outgoing, social. Reeves presents victimology: killer selecting from transient population that won't be missed immediately, targeting youth and beauty, documenting them in resort locations before killing them. Photography suggests nostalgia or obsession with resort culture itself - victims posed in dying buildings like exhibits. Callahan adds practical layer: killer has access to abandoned resorts, knows which buildings workers use for parties, can move around without suspicion, understands Lake Michigan currents for disposal. Must have photography equipment and developing capability - darkroom somewhere. Sheriff confirms no local photo shops reported suspicious developing requests. Means killer develops privately. They map the geographical pattern - all bodies recovered along eastern Door County shoreline, disposal sites suggesting knowledge of specific currents. All photographs taken at closed resort properties within five-mile resort row. Suspect pool narrowing: someone local with resort access, photography capability, maritime knowledge, and contact with seasonal workers. Period details: hand-drawn maps, pins in cork board, Polaroid copies of evidence photos. Ending: worker reports fourth person missing - Amy Sullivan's roommate Sarah hasn't been seen since July 19. Timeline holds. Race against next body discovery.

## ACT 2: INVESTIGATION & ESCALATION (Chapters 11-23)

### Chapter 11: Into the Ruins

Morning, systematic exploration of abandoned resort properties with Deputy assistance. Hotel Lakeview first - three-story limestone building, grand but decaying. Broken windows, peeling wallpaper, crystal chandeliers dusty and missing pieces. Grand ballroom where wealthy Chicagoans danced in the 1940s now has water damage and graffiti. Pool house with cracked tiles and algae-filled pool. Beach pavilion with rotted wood and missing boards. Evidence of recent activity: beer cans, cigarette butts, sleeping bags, condom wrappers - seasonal workers party here regularly. Callahan feels the creep factor - beautiful bones, sad decay, sense of being watched. Reeves notes the photography locations match architectural details in victim photos. They find actual spot where Jennifer was photographed - pool house corner, distinctive tile pattern. Killer brought her here, photographed her casually, then abducted her later. Amy Sullivan (21, Harbor View worker, knew all victims) volunteers to help - she's terrified but wants to help find Sarah. Describes party culture: they explore closed buildings, drink on private beaches, hook up in empty rooms. "There was always this maintenance guy around, but we never paid attention - just part of the scenery." Can't describe him clearly - middle-aged, quiet, had a camera sometimes. Period atmosphere: exploring dusty buildings in summer heat, flashlights needed in dark corridors, sense of trespass and danger. Ending: find Sarah's backpack hidden in Lakeview ballroom closet.

### Chapter 12: Records Search

Afternoon, county courthouse basement, dusty records room. Callahan and Reeves search employment records for resort maintenance workers, contractors, and staff 1975-1980. County clerk Helen Moffett initially resistant - privacy concerns, needs warrant. Reeves mentions federal jurisdiction, clerk relents grudgingly. Hours sorting through boxes of handwritten employment cards, typed records, carbon copies. Cross-referencing who worked at multiple resort properties. Period challenges: no computer database, everything hand-sorted, physically comparing names across different filing systems. They identify twenty-three men who worked multiple resort sites during relevant period. Narrow further: who worked all three resorts where victims were employed? List drops to seven names. Who also appears in records for closed resort properties doing maintenance? Four names remain. Cross-reference with maritime knowledge: who has boat registration or fishing license? Two names: Leonard Watts (47, maintenance supervisor) and Tom Drexler (42, handyman). Callahan remembers bartender's mention - "Tom Drexler's father managed the Lakeview." Reeves wants to run background checks on both before interviews. Sheriff calls with update: Sarah's body found in Lake Michigan off Cana Island, same pattern confirmed. Fourth victim. Photography found - shows Sarah in Hotel Lakeview, same building where they found her backpack hours ago. Killer was there recently. Both investigators tense - they're close but not fast enough. Period details: payphone calls, waiting for records checks to return, handwritten suspect lists, evidence mounting in manila folders. Ending: background check reveals Drexler's father died 1972 when Lakeview closed - six months apart.

### Chapter 13: False Lead

Morning, interview Leonard Watts at Harbor View Resort where he's repairing plumbing. Watts is cooperative, even eager to help. Admits he works multiple resorts, has master keys, knows all the properties. Grew up in Milwaukee, moved to Door County fifteen years ago for slower pace. Divorced, lives alone, loves fishing. Talks freely about knowing the victims - "nice kids, shame what happened." Too cooperative. Reeves notes his ease discussing victims seems rehearsed. Callahan suspicious of how he emphasizes his fishing knowledge - feels like establishing alibi for maritime skills. They ask about photography - Watts admits he takes landscape photos, has darkroom in basement apartment. Red flag. Request to see darkroom, Watts agrees immediately. Visit his apartment - darkroom shows landscape photography, resort buildings at sunset, nature shots. No people photography, no victims, nothing incriminating. Equipment is basic hobby level. Watts explains he documents the resort decay for nostalgia - came here on honeymoon 1962, loves the area's history. Provides alibis for victim disappearance dates - working documented jobs, some with witnesses. Reeves still suspicious, wants surveillance. Callahan thinks he's too obvious, too cooperative. Sheriff runs deeper background: no criminal record, no complaints, references check out. Period details: developing photos in chemical baths, examining negatives by hand, waiting days for alibi verification. Relationship tension: Reeves wants to pursue Watts, Callahan's gut says wrong guy. Compromise: loose surveillance while investigating Drexler. Ending: Watts asks if they've talked to "that Drexler guy who's always lurking around the old Lakeview."

### Chapter 14: Drexler's Background

Afternoon, researching Tom Drexler's history through local sources. Barb Henning at the dockside diner provides context over coffee and pie. Drexler family legacy: grandfather opened Hotel Lakeview 1928, father Hank managed it 1945-1972, family lived in manager's cottage on property. Tom grew up embedded in resort culture during its golden age, learned maintenance skills helping his father, never left Door County. When tourism declined in 1960s, Lakeview struggled. Corporate ownership bought it 1968, kept Hank as manager but cut budgets. Closed permanently 1972 when corporation dissolved. Hank died of heart attack six months later - Barb believes it was heartbreak. Tom never recovered from losing both father and the hotel. Lives alone in rented cottage near Lakeview property, works odd maintenance jobs for various resorts, seems stuck in the past. "Harmless but sad," Barb describes him. Never married, few friends, keeps to himself. She's seen him photographing old resort buildings - assumed he was documenting memories like many locals do. Sheriff adds official background: no criminal record, no complaints except two "odd behavior" reports dismissed as misunderstandings (1974: lingering around seasonal workers' beach party; 1976: found in closed resort after hours, claimed he was checking for vandalism). Current employment: maintenance contractor for Northern Hospitality Management, Eugene Marchek's holding company that owns Lakeview and four other properties. Has master keys to all five. Period texture: diner conversation, handwritten notes, locals sharing memories, building profile through community knowledge. Ending: Reeves wants to interview Drexler immediately; Callahan wants surveillance first - if he's the killer, spooking him could trigger escalation.

### Chapter 15: Surveillance

Evening into night, stakeout on Tom Drexler's cottage outside town. Small rental property, truck parked outside, lights on. Callahan and Reeves take first watch in unmarked car (Sheriff's personal vehicle to avoid department visibility). Waiting, watching, talking to pass time. Reeves asks about Milwaukee shooting incident - Callahan deflects initially, then shares basics. Justified shooting, kid had gun, but the age haunts him. Questions whether his instincts are reliable anymore, whether he hesitated or acted too fast. Reeves shares her own insecurity - brilliant at analysis but terrified of field work, afraid she'll freeze in real confrontation. First personal conversation beyond professional friction. Mutual vulnerability creates connection. Around midnight, Drexler emerges with camera bag and flashlight, drives toward resort row. They follow at distance using residential streets. He parks near Hotel Lakeview, enters through service entrance (has keys), lights visible inside moving room to room. Photographing? Searching? After hour, he exits, drives to closed cannery where Brian's body was found, photographs building exterior in moonlight, then to beach pavilion where Laura was photographed. He's visiting disposal and photography sites. Reeves wants to move in, Callahan restrains her - no crime committed, no warrant, no probable cause yet. They document his movements. Drexler returns home around 3 AM. Period details: thermos of coffee, handwritten surveillance log, no radio communication to avoid detection, navigating by county road knowledge. Ending: morning comes, both investigators exhausted but convinced - Drexler is their suspect.

### Chapter 16: The Warrant Problem

Morning, Sheriff's office, legal consultation. They present evidence to Sheriff Kowalski and county attorney: Drexler's employment access to all victim locations, family connection to Hotel Lakeview, background of "odd behavior," nighttime visits to crime scenes with camera. County attorney says insufficient for search warrant - circumstantial, no physical evidence, behavior could be explained as nostalgia or property checking (he's employed as maintenance). Need something concrete: witness identification, physical evidence, clear probable cause. Frustration mounts. Callahan wants to interview Drexler directly, pressure him, see if he breaks or makes mistake. Reeves opposes - if he's smart, he'll lawyer up, if he's the killer, direct approach could trigger violence or flight. Sheriff caught in middle, worried about both investigative paralysis and community safety. Compromise: continue surveillance, interview people who know Drexler, build circumstantial case while seeking concrete evidence. Deputy assigned to background interviews - coworkers, landlord, anyone who knows him. Meanwhile, Callahan and Reeves will re-interview seasonal workers with Drexler's photo, see if anyone identifies him from party scenes or photography incidents. Period constraints: pre-digital surveillance means manual logs, photo development takes days, no cell phone tracking, warrants require physical probable cause not just suspicion. Legal standards protect privacy even when investigators are certain. The slow pace of 1970s investigation creates tension. Ending: Amy Sullivan sees Drexler's photo (from driver's license), tentatively identifies him as "guy who was around sometimes, had camera, fixed stuff."

### Chapter 17: Community Resistance

Afternoon, meeting with resort owners and chamber of commerce at Sheriff's request (political pressure). Eugene Marchek (Lakeview owner) and three other resort owners demand investigation update while insisting on continued media blackout. Tourist season is half over, they can't afford serial killer publicity. Marchek particularly aggressive - threatens to pull cooperation, claims investigators are harassing his maintenance staff (Drexler). Callahan loses patience, nearly reveals Drexler as suspect before Reeves intervenes diplomatically. She explains investigation progress without naming suspects, requests continued access to properties, asks owners to report any unusual activity. Owners agree grudgingly but make clear their priority is economic survival, not justice. Chamber president mentions three more resorts will likely close permanently after this season - industry is dying regardless of murders. Callahan realizes the investigation is happening against backdrop of inevitable decline. Solving the case won't save the resort economy. There's tragedy beyond the murders - whole way of life ending, community identity disappearing. After meeting, Marchek pulls investigators aside, admits he barely knows Drexler despite employing him - absentee landlord, minimal oversight. Provides employment records showing Drexler worked all five Northern Hospitality properties, had access since 1973. Also mentions Drexler refused payment increase last year, said he "doesn't do it for money, does it for the resorts." Period texture: conference room in struggling resort, coffee service from depleted budget, owners in outdated business suits. Ending: driving back, Reeves and Callahan discuss how economic desperation creates investigation obstacles.

### Chapter 18: Psychological Profile

Evening, Reeves prepares formal FBI psychological profile based on evidence. Presents to Callahan and Sheriff over dinner at Barb's diner. Profile details: Male, 35-50, local with deep connection to resort culture, likely experienced personal loss connected to tourism decline, employment provides legitimate access to victims and locations, photography obsession indicates need to preserve/control, victim selection shows rage toward youth and transience, water disposal suggests comfort with Lake Michigan and possible symbolic cleansing. Motivations: grief converted to violence, sees victims as symbols of what destroyed his world, creating memorial through photography and murder, preserving moment before death (both victims' and resorts'). Likely highly organized, familiar with investigation procedures, will continue until caught or significant life stressor occurs. Reeves argues the profile fits Drexler perfectly - father's death connected to Lakeview closure, maintenance access, photography documented, victims represent careless youth destroying sacred spaces. Callahan agrees profile works but notes it could fit others too - what makes Drexler specifically the killer versus just fitting a pattern? Reeves admits they need physical evidence, not just behavioral match. Discussion of how to force his hand: announce fourth victim discovery publicly (pressure), interview him formally (confrontation), or maintain surveillance waiting for mistake (patience). Sheriff wants patience given political pressures. Callahan wants confrontation given potential fifth victim. Reeves wants more behavioral evidence first. Period atmosphere: diner booth conversation, pie and coffee, locals at other tables unaware of discussion, Barb refilling coffee and clearly listening. Ending: Deputy calls - Drexler didn't come home tonight, truck not at cottage.

### Chapter 19: The Empty Cottage

Night, emergency response to Drexler's cottage with warrant (exigent circumstances: missing potential suspect, public safety threat). Sheriff, Callahan, Reeves, two deputies breach door. Cottage is sparse, clean, obsessively organized. Living room walls covered with photographs - all resort buildings, exteriors and interiors, documenting decay. Landscapes, architectural details, no people. Kitchen minimal, bedroom neat, bathroom ordinary. No darkroom visible. No evidence of victims. Disappointment mounting - maybe wrong suspect? Then Callahan notices basement door, padlocked from inside. Breach it. Basement workshop, maintenance tools, ordinary supplies. But one corner has heavy curtain. Behind curtain: darkroom setup with enlarger, chemical trays, hanging line, but currently empty. No photographs of victims visible, no incriminating evidence. Storage cabinet locked. Force it open. Inside: hundreds of photographs, but all buildings - obsessive documentation of every resort property's decline. Different angles, lighting, seasons. Chronological organization. Evidence of obsession but not murder. Reeves searching desperately for victim photos. Nothing. Callahan finds filing cabinet with personal documents: father's death certificate, Hotel Lakeview closing notice, employment records, newspaper clippings about tourism decline. A shrine to grief but not a murder trophy room. They've either found the wrong suspect or Drexler keeps victim evidence elsewhere. Period details: physical search, Polaroid documentation of scene, evidence bags, chemical smell from darkroom, fingerprint dusting. Frustration mounting. Ending: where is Drexler, and where are the victim photographs?

### Chapter 20: The Fifth Photograph

Dawn, return to investigation office exhausted and frustrated. Drexler's cottage yielded obsession but not evidence. Still missing. Sheriff has deputies checking his known locations. Reeves reviews victim photographs again, studying backgrounds obsessively. Callahan gets coffee, tries to think like Drexler - where would he go? Reeves suddenly excited: the fourth victim photograph (Sarah) shows specific architectural detail in background - distinctive crown molding and chandelier visible. Cross-reference with resort property photos from Drexler's collection. Match found: Hotel Lakeview ballroom, specific corner. The photograph shows Sarah in exact location where they found her backpack. But there's more visible in background: darkroom equipment reflected in window glass. Enhance the image (send to FBI lab, rush processing). Fax returns (period technology - grainy but readable): reflection shows enlarger, chemical trays, hanging photographs. Drexler's darkroom isn't in his cottage - it's in Hotel Lakeview. His father's hotel, the closed building where he has legitimate access as maintenance contractor. That's where he's been developing victim photos, creating his shrine. That's where he might be now. Callahan realizes symbolic importance: Drexler is committing murders in service of preserving the resort he loved, documenting them in his father's hotel. Reeves confirms behavioral logic - returning to origin point. Sheriff organizes response team, calls for backup deputies. They'll search Hotel Lakeview immediately. Period tension: waiting for photo enhancement fax, landline coordination, physical assembly of response team. Ending: convoy of three vehicles heading to Lakeview at dawn, armed entry planned.

### Chapter 21: Hotel Lakeview

Morning, tactical entry into Hotel Lakeview with Sheriff's team. Building is massive - three floors, dozens of rooms, basement, ballroom, pool area. Split into teams: Sheriff and two deputies take upper floors, Callahan and Reeves take main floor and ballroom, two deputies cover exits. Radios for communication. Moving through grand lobby - dusty marble, broken chandelier, faded elegance. Ballroom next - huge space, water-damaged but still impressive. They find the corner from Sarah's photograph. Fresh disturbance in dust patterns - someone's been here recently. Blood trace on floor (later confirmed Sarah's). This was kill site for at least one victim. Continuing search toward basement, following maintenance corridors. Reeves tense, first real tactical situation, hand on holstered weapon. Callahan protective but trusting her training. Basement level: mechanical rooms, storage, laundry facilities from hotel operations. Finally find unmarked door, locked from inside. Callahan breaches it. Darkroom revealed - much larger than cottage setup. Walls covered with photographs: victims alive and unaware (surveillance shots from various locations), victims dead and posed (the after images). Jennifer, Brian, Laura, Sarah - all documented before and after. Dozens of other surveillance photos of seasonal workers who weren't killed - potential victims he photographed but didn't take. Evidence of selection process. Chemical trays still wet - he was here recently. Horror of seeing the complete collection. Period details: flashlight investigation, radio coordination, evidence everywhere but suspect absent. Reeves photographing everything. Callahan securing scene. Ending: radio call from deputies - they found Drexler's truck parked behind building, fresh tire tracks leaving on foot toward lake.

### Chapter 22: The Search

Late morning, search expands to grounds and shoreline. Drexler fled on foot, probably heard their entry. K-9 unit requested from state police but hours away. Track footprints through overgrown grounds toward Lake Michigan beach. Private beach, once maintained for hotel guests, now wild. Boat dock partially collapsed. Shore search reveals evidence: rope matching victim disposal, concrete blocks, marine equipment. This beach was disposal staging area - he weighted bodies here before taking them out on boat. But which boat? Marina search: Drexler doesn't own registered boat. Check with dockmaster - no boats rented to him recently. Barb from diner mentions old rowboat kept at Lakeview's private dock, leftover from hotel era. Find it pulled up in brush - shows recent use, chemical residue in bottom (chloroform traces later confirmed). He used hotel's own boat for disposal, returning to Lakeview dock after depositing bodies in lake at various points. Elegant and horrifying - completing entire murder cycle within his father's property. Drexler has hours' head start on foot. Sheriff organizes search grid, calls for additional deputies and volunteer searchers. Callahan and Reeves debate: is he running or preparing for confrontation? Reeves notes profile suggests he won't leave area - too connected to location, mission incomplete. Callahan wonders about suicide risk versus violence risk. Sheriff orders roadblocks on highways leaving peninsula. Period constraints: search coordinated by landline and radio, physical tracking required, no helicopter resources available, deputies spread thin. Time consuming. Ending: report comes in - Amy Sullivan (seasonal worker who helped earlier) is missing, last seen hour ago walking from Harbor View toward town.

### Chapter 23: Race Against Time

Afternoon, emergency response. Amy Sullivan confirmed missing, coworkers saw her leave alone around noon, mentioned meeting "maintenance guy who had questions about Sarah." Drexler lured her. She fits victim profile exactly, helped investigation (possible trigger for targeting), last piece of his collection. Reeves believes he's completing final victim before endgame - suicide or confrontation. Callahan fears they pushed him into acceleration. Sheriff organizes massive search: all deputies, volunteer firefighters, seasonal workers who knew Amy. Canvas town and resort properties. Roadblocks prevent vehicle exit but Drexler on foot with captive. Check his known locations - cottage empty, Hotel Lakeview empty (darkroom abandoned), other resort properties showing no sign. Callahan thinks symbolically - where would Drexler take final victim for his perfect preservation photograph? Most meaningful resort location? Reeves suggests the Hotel Lakeview ballroom where his father presided during glory days, where Sarah was killed. Already searched it. But Callahan remembers - the ballroom has upper balcony overlooking dance floor, access closed off for safety. Perfect elevated photography position. Return to Lakeview, move carefully toward ballroom, coordinate with Sheriff's team. Entering ballroom from multiple points. Balcony access through service stairs. Climbing carefully, old wood creaking. Period tension: radio whispers, weapons drawn, Reeves's first real danger moment, Callahan's protective instinct versus professional necessity. Reach balcony door, locked from inside. Hear voices inside - Drexler talking to someone. Amy alive. Preparation for breach. Ending: ready to move.

## ACT 3: RESOLUTION & CAPTURE (Chapters 24-30)

### Chapter 24: Confrontation

Afternoon, ballroom balcony, tactical entry. Breach door, Callahan first, Reeves covering. Balcony overlooks ballroom from twenty feet up, provides panoramic view of space where guests once danced. Tom Drexler is there with Amy Sullivan. She's drugged (chloroform) but alive, seated in chair, positioned for photograph. Drexler has camera on tripod, lighting set up, creating perfect composition. He's treating this like professional photo shoot - posing her carefully, adjusting lighting, taking exposure readings. Sees investigators enter, doesn't flee or fight. Just says "Let me finish this one." Calm, resigned. Camera aimed at Amy with ballroom's faded grandeur in background. Callahan keeps weapon trained, orders him away from victim. Drexler doesn't move aggressively, just explains: "She represents the last of them. The young ones who don't understand what this place was. I need to preserve the moment before it's all gone." Reeves edges toward Amy while keeping Drexler in sight. He's not violent now, just sad. Talks about his father - how Hank built his whole identity around the Hotel Lakeview, how the closing killed him, how Tom couldn't save either his father or the resort. The seasonal workers represented everything that destroyed the dream: transient, careless, partying in ruins, no respect for what came before. "I'm documenting the death. The before and after. The resort and the people who killed it." Photography was preservation attempt. Callahan keeps him talking while Reeves secures Amy, checks her pulse (alive, breathing, drugged). Sheriff and deputies arriving below in ballroom. Period tension: talking suspect down, no aggressive moves, treating it like suicide intervention. Ending: Drexler finally steps away from camera, hands up, surrendering quietly.

### Chapter 25: Arrest and Confession

Late afternoon, Sheriff's office, formal interview with Drexler after arrest and rights reading. County attorney present, no lawyer (Drexler waives right - wants to explain). Reeves and Callahan conduct interview while Sheriff observes. Drexler calm, detailed, treating confession like historical documentation. Describes victim selection: watched seasonal workers party in abandoned resorts, chose the most beautiful and careless, followed them, photographed them without knowledge. Approached them as fellow resort worker or maintenance guy, gained trust, offered to show them "cool abandoned areas." Used chloroform when isolated, transported to Hotel Lakeview, photographed them in ballroom, strangled them (quick, not cruel - he insists), posed their bodies, photographed again. Kept bodies in Lakeview basement freezer (old hotel equipment still functional) until ready for disposal, then weighted them and rowed them to specific lake locations matching where he'd photographed them alive. Left photo with body so they'd be found with documentation of who they were "before." Four completed victims: Jennifer, Brian, Laura, Sarah. Amy would have been fifth and final. Why stop at five? "Five photos make a collection. Five is enough to document the era." Discusses his father throughout - how Hank taught him photography, how the hotel was family legacy, how modern world destroyed everything beautiful. No remorse for victims, only for lost resort culture. They represented vandalism of sacred space. Reeves asks about psychology, Drexler surprisingly articulate about his own grief and rage. Period details: confession recorded on reel-to-reel tape, typed transcript, no video, attorney taking handwritten notes. Ending: Drexler asks if they'll preserve his photographs as evidence of resort history.

### Chapter 26: Evidence Processing

Evening and next day, systematic evidence collection from Hotel Lakeview. Crime scene team processes darkroom - hundreds of photographs catalogued, surveillance images of victims and dozens of other seasonal workers who were photographed but not killed. Before and after photos of four victims document entire murder sequence. Fingerprints throughout. Chemical analysis of darkroom materials matches evidence from bodies. Basement freezer contains trace evidence from all four victims. Beach area yields disposal tools, rope matching victim bindings, concrete blocks, boat with chemical traces. Physical evidence overwhelming - prosecution will be straightforward. Dr. Hayes completes final forensic reports confirming cause of death, chloroform exposure, timeline matching Drexler's confession. FBI lab returns analysis of photographs: all taken with same camera (Drexler's Nikon), developed using same equipment (darkroom), chronological documentation of surveillance and murder spanning June-July. Reeves compiles behavioral evidence showing premeditation, organization, psychological motivation. Callahan notifies victims' families - hardest part of case, explaining their children were murdered for symbolic reasons by someone preserving nostalgia. Parents devastated but grateful for resolution and body recovery for proper burial. Amy Sullivan recovers from chloroform exposure, traumatized but physically unharmed, provides witness statement. Media finally breaks the story - "Door County Seasonal Worker Killer Arrested." Tourism impact immediate: cancellations, fear, resort owners' worst nightmare realized. Sheriff handles press conference, credits FBI and Milwaukee PD cooperation. Period details: physical evidence processing, photographic documentation, typed reports, carbon copies, no digital storage. Everything manual and thorough. Ending: case built, trial preparation begins.

### Chapter 27: Resort Town Reckoning

Two days later, investigation wrapping up. Callahan and Reeves remaining for testimony preparation and final reports. Walk through resort row one final time, processing what happened. The murders are solved but the resort culture's death continues - three more properties announce permanent closure following publicity. Chamber of commerce estimates tourism revenue down forty percent for season. The investigation saved Amy Sullivan but couldn't save the town's economy. Conversations with locals: Barb at diner understanding why Drexler snapped but horrified by his actions, "Hank would be devastated by what Tom became." Eugene Marchek selling Lakeview and other properties at loss, exiting Door County investment entirely. Sheriff Kowalski relieved case is solved but exhausted by media pressure and community grief. Seasonal workers packing up early, summer jobs ending early as resorts close. The young people Drexler blamed for resort death are leaving, but they're not the cause - they're just witnessing the same decline. Callahan reflects on his own relationship with nostalgia: childhood memories of glamorous vacations versus adult understanding of economic change. Drexler's grief was real even though his response was monstrous. You can't preserve the past through violence. Reeves processes her first field case - success but traumatic, understanding that behavioral science doesn't capture the human sadness underlying crimes. Partnership between them evolved from friction to mutual respect, flirtation acknowledged but not acted upon (both professionals). Period atmosphere: walking empty resort grounds, summer winding down, "For Sale" signs appearing, era ending. Ending: they prepare to leave Door County, case solved but town not saved.

### Chapter 28: Departure

Final day, Sheriff's office, closing paperwork and case file transfer. Drexler arraigned, held without bail, assigned public defender, competency evaluation ordered but unlikely to succeed (he's organized and rational, just motivated by delusion). Trial expected within six months, conviction near-certain given confession and evidence. Victims' families filing civil suits against Northern Hospitality Management for negligent supervision of Drexler - unlikely to succeed but expressing rage. Sheriff grateful for resolution, recommends Callahan and Reeves for citations. FBI bureaucracy already calling Reeves back to Quantico for debriefing and next assignment. Milwaukee PD calling Callahan back - "temporary assignment" ending, his fate to be determined. Both investigators packing up the makeshift office in Harbor View Resort (which is closing permanently in two weeks). Exchange contact information, promise to stay in touch (probably won't). Discussion of what they learned: Callahan admits behavioral profiling helped narrow investigation, Reeves admits street cop instincts were crucial. Mutual respect expressed awkwardly. Light acknowledgment of attraction neither pursued. Professional goodbye, not romantic. Separate departures: Reeves driving to Chicago for flight to DC, Callahan driving to Milwaukee to face department review. Last conversation with Barb at diner over coffee and pie - she gives them both to-go boxes ("you'll need food for the drive"). She represents the town's resilience: "We survived before the resorts, we'll survive after." But sadness in her eyes. Period texture: handwritten contact info exchange, manila folders packed in boxes, physical evidence secured for transport, rotary phone calls arranging travel. The 1970s investigation ending with loose ends tied. Ending: both investigators leaving town separately, case solved, partnership dissolved.

### Chapter 29: Aftermath

One week later, separate scenes. Reeves in Quantico briefing BSU supervisors on case - her field performance praised, behavioral profile validated, assigned to next case (different location, different murders, continuing mission). Reflects on Door County as formative experience: violence is real not academic, victims are people not data sets, field work requires emotional processing not just analysis. She's changed - more confident but less certain. Keeps Callahan's contact number in desk drawer. Callahan in Milwaukee facing Internal Affairs review of shooting incident - his Door County performance counted as rehabilitation evidence, committee decides to return him to active duty with mandatory continued counseling. Relief mixed with doubt: does he want to keep doing this work? The cases pile up, the victims keep coming, the solutions don't save people from larger systemic problems. But it's the job. He's good at it. Returns to homicide rotation, new partner assignment pending. Keeps Reeves's contact number in wallet. Door County updates via newspaper clipping service: Drexler's competency hearing scheduled, Hotel Lakeview demolished by ownership to avoid liability, three more resorts closed permanently, tourism season officially worst in thirty years. Seasonal workers returned to universities, Amy Sullivan transferred to different school to escape memories. The town continues its slow decline, murder investigation just another chapter in managed death. Period details: typed reports, newspaper clippings, official commendations, departmental bureaucracy, rotary phone calls updating status. No digital communication, no social media follow-ups, just professional distance and personal memory. Ending: both investigators moving forward to next cases, Door County becoming past experience that shaped them.

### Chapter 30: Preservation

Six months later, winter. Brief epilogue scenes. Tom Drexler convicted of four counts first-degree murder, sentenced to life without parole, psychiatric evaluation continues in prison. His photograph collection catalogued as evidence, eventually transferred to Wisconsin Historical Society as documentation of resort era decline - his preservation goal achieved but through institutional archive not murder. The before/after victim photos sealed by court order, never to be published. Hotel Lakeview site cleared, sold to developer planning condominiums (never built - market too weak). Resort row has four properties remaining open, struggling through winter with skeleton staff. Barb's Dockside Diner still operating, serving locals and fewer tourists, walls still covered with old resort photos documenting glory days. She keeps newspaper clipping of investigators' commendation on wall near the photos. The seasonal workers who survived - Amy Sullivan and others - graduate college and move on with lives, Door County summer becoming dark memory. The victims' families hold private memorials, bodies buried in home communities, attempt to preserve memory of who they were "before." Callahan working Milwaukee homicide, different case, different victims, same process. Occasionally thinks about resort decay and Drexler's twisted preservation logic. Understanding that you can't stop change through violence or nostalgia. Reeves assigned to new field case in different region, applying Door County lessons, more confident investigator. Occasionally thinks about partnership chemistry and road not taken. Both moved forward but shaped by the case. Final image: winter snow covering Door County shoreline, Lake Michigan cold and gray, empty resort buildings standing like monuments to past era, preservation through abandonment rather than action. Time moves forward despite human resistance. Period closes naturally. End.
